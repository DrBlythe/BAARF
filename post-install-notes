# Thanks for using DBAARF Arch installation script!
# 
# Some post installation notes:
#
#
# 1
#
# If you installed to an SSD, edit your /etc/fstab so that the / and /home entries have 'discard' after rw
# DO NOT do this if you installed to an HDD
#
# example:
#
## Static information about the filesystems.
## See fstab(5) for details.
#
## <file system> <dir> <type> <options> <dump> <pass>
## /dev/sda1
#UUID=fcdb4284-16b4-44af-ab4d-268e9d1914e0	/         	ext4      	rw,discard,relatime 	0 1
#
## /dev/sda3
#UUID=58640576-9e79-409a-bb16-b97829220b54	/home     	ext4      	rw,discard,relatime	    0 2
#
## /dev/sda2
#UUID=50b63f2c-d114-471c-bc8d-5f3e92dd115f  	none    	swap    	defaults    0 0

# You may want to run the following command (or substitute with your correct language)
# 
# $ localectl set-locale LANG='en_US.UTF-8'
#
# I haven't have a problem with this myself, but this sets the locale with 
# systemd after the boot to make sure that it is correct.
